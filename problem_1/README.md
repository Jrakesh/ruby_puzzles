### Problem

Write a program that takes an input string, and returns which characters are consecutively repeated the most times.  If there are multiple characters, return them in `sort` order.

* "aaddddffffaa" will return `[d, f]`
* "cat dog \_\_\_" will return `[_]`

### Test

This directory contains `consecutive.rb` and `consecutive_test.rb`.  Please implement the methods in `consecutive.rb` so that all of the tests in `consecutive_test.rb` pass when the following command is executed:

    ruby consecutive_test.rb
